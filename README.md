## How to Play

### Objective
Capture **all of your opponent's stones** on the board.

### Rules
1. **Setup:** The board starts empty. The **Red** player moves first.  
2. **Turns:** Players alternate placing one hexagon of their color.  
3. **Placement Rules:**
   - You **cannot** place adjacent to your own color (unless capturing).  
   - You **can** place adjacent to your opponent's color.  
   - You **can** place in empty spaces not touching any hexagon.  
4. **Capturing:**
   - Groups = connected hexagons of the same color.  
   - If your group is **larger** than an adjacent opponentâ€™s group, you capture it.  
   - Captured groups are removed from the board.  
5. **Special Cases:**
   - After a successful capture, the same player gets another turn.  
   - A player cannot make a move that would leave them with no hexagons.
